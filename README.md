# KitchenBuddy 🍽️

KitchenBuddy is a smart pantry and grocery companion app that helps users track what they have, reduce food waste, and get recipe ideas based on available ingredients.

The goal is to make it effortless to know **what you own, what’s expiring soon, and what you can cook right now**.
